            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <img src="images/ford.jpg" alt="Ford Vehicle" class="picture">
            <h3>
                <a href="http://www.ford.com">Ford Tough</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This picture is a good example of Visual Hierarchy. This Vehicle has 
                the "scaled" up illustration. The image all around the vehicle is 
                slightly blurred as well. I do feel that a picture next to a big 
                body of water really gives the depth effet to any object in a given picture.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <img src="images/samsung.jpg" alt="Samsung Products" class="picture">
            <h3>
                <a href="http://www.samsung.com">Samsung is the best</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This picture possesses a very visible repetition effect.
                It displays the phones in a repetitious pattern. Obviously
                the circular pattern but also the color pattern as well as 
                it repeats throughout the circle.

            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <img src="images/nike.jpg" alt="Nike Shoes" class="picture">
            <h3>
                <a href="http://www.nike.com">Nike - Just Do It!</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                You could tell the model in this photo hated the photographer
                by the way thier foot is perfectly aligned with one another. Though
                it isnt a straight horizontal alignment, the angled alignment plays
                well with each other
